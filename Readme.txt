 KNOWN BUGS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spider enemy goes backwards when wandering.

Occasionally, the player will spawn at the default spawn position when transitioning between scenes.

Sometimes an enemy gets stuck on navmesh when wandering.

Sometimes an enemy tries to go into wall when wandering.

Not a bug but due to lots of gamebreaking bugs, we decided not to include any bounty bosses as mentioned in the final presentation.
